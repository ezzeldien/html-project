            In recent years, the development of AI technologies has been driven primarily by commercial interests. However, the number of non-commercial projects leveraging AI technologies to deliver socially beneficial outcomes has proliferated worldwide. These projects can be described as ‘socially good AI’ (hereafter ‘AI4SG’1).</p>
            <br>
            
    AI4SG facilitates the attainment of socially good outcomes that were previously unfeasible, unaffordable or simply less achievable in terms of efficiency and effectiveness.
     It offers unprecedented opportunities across many domains, and could be of great importance, at a time when problems are increasingly global, complex and interconnected. For example, AI can provide much-needed support to improve health outcomes and mitigate environmental risk. This is also a matter of synergy: AI4SG builds on, and augments, other recent examples of digital technologies adopted to advance socially beneficial objectives,
     such as ‘big data for development. As a result, AI4SG is gaining traction within the AI community and with policymakers.
